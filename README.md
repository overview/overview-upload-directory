# overview-upload

Upload files to an [Overview](https://www.overviewdocs.com) document set.

# Installation

Requires [python3](https://www.python.org/).

`pip3 install overview_upload`, maybe with `sudo` in front. That will install a
`overview-upload` program in your path.

# Command-Line Usage

`overview-upload --server <SERVER_URL> --token <API_TOKEN> [options] DIRECTORY`

Required arguments:

* `SERVER_URL` is the base URL for the server, which defaults to http://localhost:9000 for use with [overview-local](https://github.com/overview/overview-local).
* `API_TOKEN` is required. It's the access token for a particular document set, which you get like this
    1. Browse to your document set. The URL will look like `http://localhost:9000/documentsets/123456`.
    2. Note the document set number, in this case `123456`
    3. Browse to `https://www.overviewdocs.com/documentsets/[your number here]/api-tokens` and click "Generate token".
* `DIRECTORY` is a path to the file or directory you want to upload.

Optional arguments:

* `--skip-duplicate` (the default), `--noskip`: skip files that are already
  part of the document set your API token refers to. Files are compared by
  their sha1 hashes, meaning even if you move or rename the file it will not
  be uploaded if the document set already includes it. This feature is helpful
  for synchronizing a local directory with an Overview document set; however,
  it will not delete Overview documents corresponding to files you deleted
  locally.
* `--split-by-page`: tell Overview to turn a multi-page file (like a PDF or
  Word document) into several Overview documents.
* `--ocr` (the default), `--no-ocr`: tell Overview what to do when a PDF page
  has only images but no text. Overview can either try to recognize text using
  [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) (which is slow and
  will prevent you from viewing the document set until it finishes), or it can
  assume the page contains no text.

If you upload a single file, its Overview document title will be its filename,
without any directory information. If you upload a directory, filenames will
include subdirectory informatin: for instance, if `overview-upload /some/path`
uploads `/some/path/to/file.pdf`, the Overview document title will be
`to/file.pdf`.

# API usage

You can also `import overview_upload` from your own Python3 program and then
use the `overview_upload.Upload` class. See the `overview-server` source code
for more information.
